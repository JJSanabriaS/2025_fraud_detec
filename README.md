# Fake Bill Detection from PDF using Python

## Introduction

Fraudulent billing is a major issue in businesses and financial institutions. Fake invoices can cause:

    * Financial losses
    * Tax complications
    * Trust issues between companies

This project focuses on detecting fake bills automatically by extracting and analyzing information from PDF invoices using Python.

## Problem Statement

Manual invoice verification:

    * Is time-consuming
    * Prone to human error
    * Difficult at large scale

We need an automated system that:

    * Extracts data from PDF bills
    * Validates invoice structure and content
    * Identifies suspicious or fake invoices

## Objectives

    * Extract text and structured data from PDF invoices
    * Validate important invoice fields
    * Detect anomalies using rule-based logic or machine learning
    * Classify invoices as Real or Fake

## Technologies Used

    * Python
    * PDF Processing Libraries
        * PyPDF2
        * pdfplumber
    * Data Processing
        * Pandas
        * NumPy
    * Machine Learning
        * Scikit-learn
    * Regex (Regular Expressions)
